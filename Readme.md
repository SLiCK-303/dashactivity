# Dash activity

## About
The dash activity module allows you to see recent users who have accessed your shop and other statistics.  This is a modified version of the stock thirty bees module, but not using Google analytics, and updated to use either [productcomments](https://github.com/thirtybees/productcomments), or [Datakick's revws](https://github.com/getdatakick/revws) module.
